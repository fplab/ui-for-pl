Programmable Physical Environments
==================================

Overview
--------

Physical things includes nearly everything that will appear in life of human beings. When it comes to programmable physical things, the term should refer to a kind of physical system which might be a combination of software and hardware which can respond to the analog world. When we say 'environment', we focus more on the interactive function of this physical system with human beings. Now we can derive a definition for programmable physical environment, which is an interactively programmable physical system that can sense and respond to the real world.

Programmable physical environment has a broad definition and it is used in various fields. The usage included educational use, virtual/augmented reality, factory manufacture, internet of things, building architecture, etc. The term still has a long way for improvement. In the future, programmable physical environment may become more common in the society as a combination of various technology systems.

Embodied Cognition
------------------

One related theory to programmable physical environment is the embodied cognition. Embodied cognition is the theory that many features of cognition are shaped by aspects of the entire body of the organism. High level mental constructs and performance on various cognitive tasks are all included in the features of cognition. It points out that the cognition of beings is related to the entire aspects of the body. When coming to programmable physical environment, it should remind the designers in what ways can human beings interact with the systems.

  This wiki page gives a explanation of embodied cognition

Design Insight
--------------

As a programmable physical environment, the human interation with the system is very important. How human will interact with the system should also be a research topic of programmable physical environment.

Here is a worry about future technologies, where people interact with technologies mostly with their fingers.

  .. bibliography:: programmable_PE.bib
    :filter: key == "bret2011rant"

  The author gives a deep explanation of definition of a tool: A tool addresses human needs by amplifying human capabilities, and a tool convert what people can do to what people want to do. However, most technologies for now focus more on what they can fit people's needs, but less on how they can fit people's capabilities.

  The author holds the opinon that human think not only through part of their body, like visual or auditory, but with the whole parts of body.

In the term programmable physical environment, "environment" is one of the most important part to its definition. Based on the theory of embodied cognition, programmable physical environment should give more focus on interaction between people and the system. For the future design, how people will interact with the environment should be considered more carefully.

Dynamicland
-----------

Dynamicland is a research group, who are inventing a new computational medium where people work together with real objects in the real world, not alone with virtual objects on screens.

.. container:: bib-item

  .. bibliography:: programmable_PE.bib
    :filter: key == "dynamicland2019web"

The group have a work that has a close idea to embodied cognition. The computational media is derived from everyday things, like papers, which people can physically feel them and use them. Based on these objects, they are extended with computing capabilities. With the help of cameras, projectors and sensors on the ceiling, each objects can become a computer. The idea is to make a whole room a computer, bring usually virtual things, like programs, into the real world, and build a whold environment where people can think and work physically.

One example about what people can do in dynamicland is as the following.

.. container:: bib-item

  .. bibliography:: programmable_PE.bib
    :filter: key == "omar2018geokit"

  The `Geokit`, a tool that can build and view map, is not some programs or apps that stored in some virtual places, but some pieces of real paper. With the set of paper, the room get the ability to build and view maps.

Dynamicland actually gives a deep insight on how an environment can be like when combining computer to the whole space. It not only provides a programmable physical system, but a very new way on how people can compute with the environment.

Tangible Media Group
--------------------

The group have designed many human-computer interactive systems, ans many of them are quite related to creating a programmable physical environment.

Other Applications
------------------

Programmable physical environments have appeared in many fields. It is hard to say when such concept is first generated. In 1970s, researchers have proposed the idea of programmable industrial automation, which enable factories to efficiently complete work. Though some programmable physical systems don't provide a very flexible interface for people, they are very close to the definition of programmable physical environment.  Here will list some application of programmable physical environment or systems in different fields.

Educational Use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One common application of programmable physical system is in the education field, especially for children. LEGO programmable brick is a tool that enable children to apply simple programs to LEGO bricks. The whole complicated programs are wrapped in a device and by working with instructions showed by the device, children, who usually don't have any knowledge of programming, can set some behaviours for LEGO bricks or motors.
Some research dig more about the programmable bricks and make more developments.

Factory Manufacture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The automation of industrial manufacture has a long history of development. In the 20th century, industrial automation was well advanced in two areas of manufacture, including homogeneous products and mass manufacture of discrete products. In old time, the industrial automation was still a kind of "hard" or "fixed" automation, which doesn't enable much flexibility.

  .. bibliography:: programmable_PE3.bib
    :filter: key == "nitzan1976industrial"

As the development of technology, industrial automation enables more flexible work, which enables the same automated equipment to be programmed to perform different tasks. The development of the controller systems gave the growth of research on designing corresponding interface for the controller systems. Here are some papers on different interface architecture for programmable controller systems.

For now, there are many researches on programmable logic circuit. For college learning and industrial production, software for programming logic circuits is widely used.

However, it is quite hard to divide these application as a branch of programmable physical environment. Most of the applications in factory manufacture are surely including programmable physical things, but there's merely elements of an "environment". The interaction between people and the systems is still limited, especially for the sensing part. The liveness of such systems may be still at a low level, as in industrial automation, it is hard to rapidly see the results from the changes to the programs.

Internet of things (IOT)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A possible future is that computing will be ouside the realm of the traditional desktops. Many of the objects surrouding people's life will be on the network in certain form. There are more ways for people to have interaction with such a network of physical things.

.. container:: bib-item

  .. bibliography:: programmable_PE3.bib
    :filter: key == "luigi2012socialiot"

An example of the interactive interface to IOT is the Echo Dot of Amazon, a kind of intelligent virtual assistants. Similar products in people's life include Siri, Assistant Cortana. Such intelligent virtual assistants can provide many functions for people's daily life. With connection to cloud database, they can compute various requests from people. Besides fetching data from cloud database, they can have control of other physical objects in the network. They serve as an interface to IOT and internet for people to interact with.

However, though the intelligent virtual assistants give a good start to programmable IOT interfaces, there are worries about the security and privacy. There's still a long way for it to become a mature programmable physical environment.

  The article describes some possible secure problem for intelligent virtual assistants.

Another related research is about aggregate programmaing, which refers to program an aggregate of individual devices as a whole. It provides a way that simplifies the design, creation, and maintenance of complex IoT software systems. The main strategies include making implicit interaction between devices, composing geometric constructions, summarizing data and streaming to other regions, and generalizably constructions for space–time computing.

Building Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In tradition, architectures like buildings and houses are designed to protect people from external threats, which requires the buildings to be solid and hard. However, this feature also makes the architecture hard to fit the dynamic demands of people to the space. One way to add flexibility to architectures is to apply a programmable physical environment, which combines the flexible software and the solid builidings.

One example is `Squama`, a modular visiblity control of walls and windows for programmable physical architecture.

.. container:: bib-item

  .. bibliography:: programmable_PE.bib
    :filter: key == "rekimoto2012squama"

  It presents a programmable wall and window, which can change transparency in modular way.

The Squama wall and window is grid-like, where the transparency of each grid can be controlled. One of the usage is to hide confidential content in the room from people outside the wall. With the sensors and camera, the system can track people's sight and give a real-world pixelization to the content inside the room. Also, the system can provide other functions based on people's various needs.

There are also applications in security of physical architecture. One example is a programmable wireless environment for physical layer security.

  The research team developed an intelligent reflecting surface. By adjusting the reflecting coefficient, the surface can send the incident electromagnetic wave to desired direction, which can improve the secrecy of information transport.

Biology
~~~~~~~

Programmable physical interfaces have also appeared in biology field. One example is the Body Integrated Programmable Joints Interface described in the following paper.
