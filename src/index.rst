User Interfaces for Programming Languages
==========================================

This is an online compendium covering research into user interfaces for programming languages, broadly construed.
It is organized hierarchically into topic areas. Each topic area includes a brief overview followed by an **annotated bibliography** that aims to clearly and concisely summarize the relevant academic literature, as well as notable non-academic designs.

Contributions
-------------
This is very much a **living document** and community contributions are encouraged. 
Click the "Edit on GitHub" link on any page to quickly propose an edit. 
For more substantial edits, e.g. to add a new topic area, you can `fork the repository <https://github.com/fplab/ui-for-pl>`_ and make a pull request on GitHub.


Contributors
************
  * This compendium is maintained by `Cyrus Omar <https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~comar>`_ (comar@umich.edu) and other members of the `Future of Programming Lab <https://github.com/fplab/fplab/wiki/The-Future-of-Programming-Lab>`_ at the University of Michigan.

  * During the Fall 2019 term, students taking the `EECS 598: User Interfaces for Programming Languages <http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~comar/courses/ui-for-pl/>`_ course at Michigan will be making the first wave of contributions to this document.
