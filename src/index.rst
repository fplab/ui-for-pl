User Interfaces for Programming Languages
=========================================================

  **compendium**. *n*. a collection of concise but detailed information about a particular subject.

You have found an online compendium covering research into user interfaces for programming 
languages, broadly construed.
Each topic includes a brief overview followed by an **annotated bibliography**. 
The aim is to summarize and provide pointers into the literature for the benefit of researchers and designers
working in this exciting and evolving field.

Contributions
-------------
This is very much a `living document <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_document>`_ and community contributions of any size are encouraged. 

.. todo::
  The compendium includes **Todo items** in a box like this one to help guide community contributions. 
  However, all manner of contributions are encouraged, including edits to existing text and reorganization efforts.
  You could even just add a new Todo item, even if you don't yet have the bandwidth to discharge it!
